// This is my practice for a code loop

//for (i=0;i<10; i++) {
//    console.log(i)
// }

//console.log("hello".length)

//console.log("hello".toUpperCase())

//console.log("hello".toLowerCase())

//console.log("hello".trim())

//console.log(Math.random());

//console.log(Math.floor(Math.random() * 10))

//Search finds the value of a specified object in a string, with the first letter represented by 0, and so on
//console.log("hello".search("o"))

//lastIndexOf returns a value of -1 if the value to search for does not occur, since "hello" has no substrings, this is what happens for this 
//console.log("hello".lastIndexOf())

//I was thoroughly confused by the W3scxhools resource due to it using different terminology from Visual Studio Code
//for example, Var. instead of console.log at the start of each string method.

//console.log("All Around the world".toUpperCase().charAt(7));

//let is a variable that can have the value reassigned. In this instance, Coffee becomes tea

//let favouriteDrink = "coffee";
//favouriteDrink = "tea";
//console.log(favouriteDrink)

//Coffee can now be placed into a string. Usable as a codeable part of a phrase.

//console.log("my favourite drink is " + favouriteDrink);

//another way of doing this can be using bracers, placing the full thing in ` instead of with "

//console.log(`my favourite drink is now ${favouriteDrink}`);

//const is a variable which prevents a value from being changed. Since coffee is now a constant instead of a let, trying to change the value for favorite 
//drink to tea results in an error

//const favouriteDrink = "coffee";
//favouriteDrink = "coffee";
